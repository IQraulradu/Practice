        <p id="Text-Creator">For a creator of visuals, this has got to be one of the strangest briefs you’ll ever receive: “In a best-case scenario, people will close their eyes and not watch your animation.” However, this was (albeit half) of the brief given to the animators behind the new Netflix and Vox series Headspace Guide to Meditation. The series is the most recent chapter in the phenomenal success story of Headspace, the globally popular meditation app created by British mindfulness expert and ordained Buddhist monk Andy Puddicombe with his business partner Richard Pierson. Having launched as an events company in 2010, its guided meditation exercises narrated by Andy were first brought to life through animation by Nexus Studios, which created over 150 characters and environments to visualise the app’s teachings. Then Headspace signed a three-series deal with Netflix, and the company had a new challenge: how to make meditation, a practice which at its very core is the antithesis of binge-watching escapism, TV-worthy.</p>

        <p id="FactText">In fact, that baton was handed to a supergroup of animation studios and directors, each tasked with creating 20-minute episodes based on a teaching led by Andy. Four studios and eleven animation directors were involved: Strange Beast with Hannah Jacobs and Lara Lee, Magnus Atom and Yuval Haker; Blink Industries with Alex Grigg, Katy Wang and Gabriel de Bruin; Compost Creative with Colin Thornton and Neil Wilson; and Augenblick Studios’ Aaron Augenblick with Devin Clark; all with a team of animators in tow. They all worked with series art director Drew Takahashi, who explains that the project required a shift in perspective for everyone involved. “Many of us have done our share of commercials where every second is there to stimulate or seduce. In this case the subject seemed to demand a different use of the medium,” Drew tells It’s Nice That. Instead, the team “kept old media habits at bay and sought calm,” he says. “We consciously injected space, air to breathe and often used breathing to pace the shots.” The result is something that could be a new genre for television. It sits somewhere nearby slow TV, experimental music videos and informational films, but it is also none of those things. Its intention is not to draw your eye or add excitement, but to be passive and secondary; something to visually guide the lesson but not detract from the point of the whole thing, to focus on yourself and not the TV.</p>
