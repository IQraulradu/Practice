        <p id="Text-Creator">For a creator of visuals, this has got to be one of the strangest briefs you’ll ever receive: “In a best-case scenario, people will close their eyes and not watch your animation.” However, this was (albeit half) of the brief given to the animators behind the new Netflix and Vox series Headspace Guide to Meditation. The series is the most recent chapter in the phenomenal success story of Headspace, the globally popular meditation app created by British mindfulness expert and ordained Buddhist monk Andy Puddicombe with his business partner Richard Pierson. Having launched as an events company in 2010, its guided meditation exercises narrated by Andy were first brought to life through animation by Nexus Studios, which created over 150 characters and environments to visualise the app’s teachings. Then Headspace signed a three-series deal with Netflix, and the company had a new challenge: how to make meditation, a practice which at its very core is the antithesis of binge-watching escapism, TV-worthy.</p>

        <p id="FactText">In fact, that baton was handed to a supergroup of animation studios and directors, each tasked with creating 20-minute episodes based on a teaching led by Andy. Four studios and eleven animation directors were involved: Strange Beast with Hannah Jacobs and Lara Lee, Magnus Atom and Yuval Haker; Blink Industries with Alex Grigg, Katy Wang and Gabriel de Bruin; Compost Creative with Colin Thornton and Neil Wilson; and Augenblick Studios’ Aaron Augenblick with Devin Clark; all with a team of animators in tow. They all worked with series art director Drew Takahashi, who explains that the project required a shift in perspective for everyone involved. “Many of us have done our share of commercials where every second is there to stimulate or seduce. In this case the subject seemed to demand a different use of the medium,” Drew tells It’s Nice That. Instead, the team “kept old media habits at bay and sought calm,” he says. “We consciously injected space, air to breathe and often used breathing to pace the shots.” The result is something that could be a new genre for television. It sits somewhere nearby slow TV, experimental music videos and informational films, but it is also none of those things. Its intention is not to draw your eye or add excitement, but to be passive and secondary; something to visually guide the lesson but not detract from the point of the whole thing, to focus on yourself and not the TV.</p>
        
        <p id="EachText">Each episode has a theme and promises a grand life lesson – how to deal with anger or stress or pain, how to let go, be kind, get started, fall in love with life, or even “achieve your limitless potential”. Each has an introduction to the theme, in which we hear Andy explaining through anecdotes and scientific evidence around how our body and mind react to certain situations, and how we can use various meditative practices to better understand this and react more healthily. These sections are packed with metaphors, which the animators bring to life through their individual styles (though importantly all with a Headspace vibe). Then there’s the meditation exercise itself, an altogether different and bizarre brief for the animators, which Aaron Augenblick explained at the start of this piece as basically being told their work would ideally not be seen. These stripped-back, abstract visuals are designed to visualise a process going on inside the participant’s mind during meditation. They, therefore, had to be as calm and soothing – and not distracting – as possible. The only stipulation was that they centre on the Headspace orange dot. On being told the idea was for people not to watch their work, Aaron adds “usually our goal is the very opposite!” and brilliantly describes his studio’s solution as creating “a kind of animation lava lamp. Something with a warming presence that you don’t necessarily need to look at in order to feel it in the room”.</p>

        <p id="WithText">With only essential forms on screen, a lot of importance is also placed on colour, with these exercise segments being subdued yet positive, comforting and subtly tied-in with the Headspace brand, for added familiarity. Astutely, Katy and Gabriel have also used it like a dimmer switch to signify the start and end of the exercise, introducing a gradual colour change from light to dark when the viewer is meant to close their eyes, and the reverse when it’s time to return to the room. As for the first sections of the films, they live in a similar visual universe but with more traditional creative tasks to face. Andy’s stories are peppered with metaphors and scientific case studies that were no doubt helpful for the animators to bring to life, but it was important they were accessible across continents and demographics. Hannah says the use of abstract shapes to represent a cluttered mind came up as a useful visual metaphor, while many of the directors say they looked to nature for inspiration, not just because it is broadly relatable but also because of its innate links with the peaceful state of meditation. “There’s something inherently calming about natural imagery,” Magnus says. “When you pay attention to the cycles of nature – the life, death, and changing patterns – you can find metaphors for almost anything in life, both externally and internally. Perhaps that’s the Eastern philosophy in me talking.”</p>
        <p id="WholeText">“As a whole, I honestly cannot compare it to anything else I’ve done during my career.”</p>
        <p id="AptlyText">Aptly, it seems that for many of the directors, the creative process was interwoven deeply with the subject at hand, in that engaging in Andy’s teachings produced ideas that envisaged a meditative state. “I’m already an avid meditator, even more so since the start of lockdown, but I thought actually sitting down and meditating might be an interesting way to approach the design conceptually and aesthetically,” Magnus describes. “I don’t know if it’s normal, but sometimes if I’ve been meditating for long enough and I finally reach that ‘inner peace’ around the 20-minute mark, I start to see moving colours and lights. Perhaps it’s just the blood flowing through my eyelids,” he laughs, “but I tried really hard to visualise an aesthetic around what I saw there.” This materialised as “fuzzy light patterns and morphing colours” a soft style they later referred to as “airbrushy”. “As a whole, I honestly cannot compare it to anything else I’ve done during my career,” he concludes – a sentiment echoed by most of the collaborators, with Colin describing it as “very rare” to be able to make something as “conceptual and extremely abstract, and for it to be on Netflix!” And with that, he roundly sums up a highly unexpected and surprisingly revolutionary project for animation and TV as a whole. One that could have started a new genre, that subverts the very nature of TV as a distraction and makes it a tool with which to take care of our own mental health, and strive for emotional calm, during a fitting moment in our societal history.</p>
