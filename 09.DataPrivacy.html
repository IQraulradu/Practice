            <div class="Terms">Terms of service</div>
            <div class="Rectangle30"></div>
            <div class="Scope">1. Scope</div>
            <p id="General-Text">These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) are an integral part of the delivery agreement concluded between you (hereinafter “ Client ”) and XY GmbH (hereinafter “ Contractor ”) (hereinafter “ Agreement ”)”). All other deliveries, services and offers by the contractor are also made exclusively in accordance with these terms and conditions. Changes and additions to these terms and conditions as well as conflicting or supplementary conditions - in particular general terms and conditions - of the client are not recognized by the contractor, unless there is an express written confirmation by the contractor. In the event that these terms and conditions compete with those of the client, these general terms and conditions take precedence. <br/><br/>The version valid at the time of the conclusion of the contract is decisive. However, the contractor reserves the right to make changes to the general terms and conditions, so that the then current general terms and conditions are authoritative for subsequent orders. <br/> <br/> These general terms and conditions also apply to all future contractual relationships, even if this is not expressly indicated in additional contracts. Contractor and client are jointly referred to as the contractual parties or individually as the contractual partner.</p>
            <div class="Offers">2. Offers, subsidiary agreements</div>
            <p id="Unless-Text">Unless otherwise stated, all offers made by the contractor are non-binding and subject to change with regard to all of the data provided, including the price. Information contained on the homepage, in catalogs, brochures, product descriptions, cost estimates, etc. is only binding if it is referred to in the order confirmation. Illustrations, information on quantities, dimensions and designs, appearance, prices and conditions in brochures, catalogs and the like are only examples. <br/> <br/> The quantities, dimensions and execution details given in the respective order confirmations, the prices and conditions are to be checked by the contractual partner immediately after receipt of the order confirmation. If the order confirmation contains changes to the order, these are deemed to have been approved by the client, unless the client contradicts them in writing within five calendar days after the order confirmation has been sent. Cost estimates are only binding if they have been drawn up in writing and expressly designated as binding.</p>
            <div class="Contract">3. Contract initiation and conclusion</div>
            <div class="Agreements">Agreements, sales, orders and contracts with the contractor must be made in writing and are only concluded with the contractor’s written (order) confirmation. Written or electronic declarations on the part of the contractor or invoices are deemed to have been received by the contract partner if they are sent by post with an address of the contract partner known to the contractor, have been sent by fax to a fax number of the contract partner known to the contractor or if they are called up by the contract partner under normal circumstances can. <br/> <br/>The contractual partner agrees that all business documents, invoices etc. are electronically created and sent to him.</div>
            <div class="Prices">4. Prices, terms of payment</div>
            <div class="All-Text">All prices quoted are net prices and do not include statutory sales tax. Unless otherwise specified in the contract, the contractor considers himself bound to the prices for four (4) weeks. Payments by the client must be made free of charges and deductions.  <br/> <br/> The client can only offset or withhold amounts due in cases in which the client’s claims have either been acknowledged in writing by the contractor or have been finally confirmed by a court. Unless otherwise agreed, payments made by the client are non-refundable. <br/> <br/> In the event of default in payment, the client must reimburse the contractor for the appropriate and necessary costs incurred as a result of the default in payment, such as expenses for reminders in the amount of EUR 20 per reminder, collection attempts, storage costs and any judicial or extrajudicial legal fees. The default interest is 9.2% above the base rate per annum. <br/> <br/> Invoices are due within ten (10) days of the invoice date without deduction. In the event of default of payment, the contractor <br/> <br/> reserves the right to assign, sell or hand over the claims against the client to factoring companies for collection. The associated costs, such as dunning and collection charges, are borne by the client. The contractor is entitled to send invoices to the client in electronic form. The client expressly agrees to the sending of invoices in electronic form by the contractor. Flat rate <br/> <br/> / remuneration agreements must be expressly designated as such and in writing in order to be effective. As a result, the services are by no means flat-rate (fake flat-rate price). Changes to the service content are not included in this flat rate. If the terms of payment are not adhered to, or if the contractor becomes aware of circumstances that are likely to reduce the customer’s creditworthiness, all claims are due immediately. The contractor is then entitled to carry out outstanding deliveries or other contractual services only against prepayment and to withdraw from the contract after setting a deadline and to assert claims for damages. <br/> <br/> The exact prices for the services and deliveries of the contractor can be found in the price list attached to the offer, the order confirmation or the contract. The prices quoted are “ex works” in the warehouse of the contractor in Parndorf, Austria. <br/><br/> All goods and items delivered by the contractor remain the property of the contractor until all services provided by the contractor have been paid for in full.</div>
