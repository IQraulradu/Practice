In the event that these terms and conditions compete with those of the client, these general terms and conditions take precedence. <br/><br/>The version valid at the time of the conclusion of the contract is decisive. However, the contractor reserves the right to make changes to the general terms and conditions, so that the then current general terms and conditions are authoritative for subsequent orders. <br/> <br/> These general terms and conditions also apply to all future contractual relationships, even if this is not expressly indicated in additional contracts. Contractor and client are jointly referred to as the contractual parties or individually as the contractual partner.</p>

Illustrations, information on quantities, dimensions and designs, appearance, prices and conditions in brochures, catalogs and the like are only examples. <br/> <br/> The quantities, dimensions and execution details given in the respective order confirmations, the prices and conditions are to be checked by the contractual partner immediately after receipt of the order confirmation. If the order confirmation contains changes to the order, these are deemed to have been approved by the client, unless the client contradicts them in writing within five calendar days after the order confirmation has been sent. Cost estimates are only binding if they have been drawn up in writing and expressly designated as binding.</p>
